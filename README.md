### Info:
This game was developed on a Raspberry Pi computer using vim.tiny,  
except for the finishing touches and final playtest.  
I didn't get to spend as much time on this as I would have liked (due  
to homework, problems with my Raspberry Pi, and problems with getting  
Git to work) although I did get done most of what I wanted to get done.  
### Controls:
Hold UP or DOWN to move up or down   
Hold SPACE to move right two player widths  
You can get hit 3 times before the game ends  
Try to get a high score!
